<p align="center">The Conditional Access Validator is part the CA framework: the <a href="https://www.jbaes.be/CAB">Conditional Access Blueprint</a></p>

# üöÄ About

The Conditional Access Validator is a PowerShell tool that automatically generates a HTML report with:
- <a href="https://maester.dev">Maester.dev</a> test for Conditional access
- a flow chart of Conditional Access
- the Conditional Access Matrix (a CSV with the included/excluded state per user per CA policy)
- Conditional Access Persona Report

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/jasperbaes/Conditional-Access-Validator
cd Conditional-Access-Validator
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph
```

Authenticating can be done with the `Connect-MgGraph` command ('Policy.Read.All', 'Directory.Read.All', 'Application.Read.All') or with an App Registration. To use an App Registration, create the file `settings.json` in the root of the project and set the credentials in following JSON object:

```json
{
    "tenantID": "",
    "clientID": "",
    "clientSecret": ""
}
```

# üíª Usage

```powershell
# Connecting with your user account
Connect-MgGraph
.\run.ps1

# Connecting with an App Registration
.\run.ps1

# OR if you want to include CA policies that are in 'report-only' mode
Connect-MgGraph
.\run.ps1 -IncludeReportOnly

# OR if you want to skip the User Impact Matrix
Connect-MgGraph
.\run.ps1 -SkipUserImpactMatrix

# OR if you want to limit the User Impact Matrix to the first 10 users
Connect-MgGraph
.\run.ps1 -UserImpactMatrixLimit 10
```

# üí° Hardcoded rules

For each Conditional Access policy, a test is created based on the configured properties in the CA policy itself.

Some hard-coded rules:
- Conditional Access policies are imported sorted on their name.
- If the CA policy is scoped on `'All users'`, we limit the scope to 5 random users. These accounts are indicated with `'(random)'` after their UPN
- If the CA policy is scoped on a group (included or excluded), we limit the scope to 5 random users of that group. These accounts are indicated with `'(random)'` after their UPN
- If the CA policy is scoped on `'All guests'`, we limit the scope to 2 random guests. These accounts are indicated with `'(random)'` after their UPN
- If the CA policy is scoped on `'All resources'` cloud apps, we limit the scope to `Office 365 Exchange Online`, `Office 365 SharePoint Online` and `Office 365 Portal`
- If the CA policy is scoped on `Office365` cloud apps, we limit the scope to `Office 365 Exchange Online`, `Office 365 SharePoint Online` and `Office 365 Portal`
- If the CA policy is scoped on more than 3 cloud apps, we limit the scope to the first 3 applications
- If the CA policy is scope on a Named Location, we add tests for each IP range of the Named Location
- If the CA policy is scope on a Named Location, the country of the test will always be `'FR'` (France)

# üöß Current limitations  
- Insider risk is not supported yet
- User principal risk is not supported yet
- Device properties are not supported yet
- Session controls are not supported yet
- Directory roles are not supported by Maester
- Excluded guest users are not supported, only included guests are supported
- Guest types are not supported by Maester. In each case, 2 random guests are chosen for the test.
- JSON Crack is integrated to visualize the flow chart. JSON Crack has a size limitation in their free plan.

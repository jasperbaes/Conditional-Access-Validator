The Maester Conditional Access Test Generator is part of tool #4 in the <a href="https://www.jbaes.be/CAB">Conditional Access Blueprint</a>, a CA framework.

# üöÄ About

The Maester Conditional Access Test Generator is a PowerShell tool that automatically generates <a href="https://maester.dev">Maester.dev</a> test for Conditional access, based on your current Conditional Access setup. <a href="https://maester.dev">Maester.dev</a> is a Microsoft Security test automation framework.

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

TODO: installation video

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/jasperbaes/Maester-Conditional-Access-Test-Generator
cd Maester-Conditional-Access-Test-Generator
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication
```

Authenticating can be done with the `Connect-MgGraph` command or with an App Registration. To use an App Registration, create the file `settings.json` in the root of the project and set the credentials in following JSON object:

```json
{
    "tenantID": "",
    "clientID": "",
    "clientSecret": ""
}
```

# üíª Usage

```powershell
# Connecting with your user account
Connect-MgGraph
.\run.ps1

# Connecting with an App Registration
.\run.ps1

# OR if you want to include CA policies that are in 'report-only' mode
.\run.ps1 -IncludeReportOnly
```

# üí° Hardcoded rules

For each Conditional Access policy, a test is created based on the configured properties in the CA policy itself. Some hard-coded rules:

- Conditional Access policies are imported sorted on their name.
- if the CA policy is scoped on `'All users'`, we limit the scope to 5 random users. These accounts are indicated with `'(random)'` after their UPN
- if the CA policy is scoped on a group (included or excluded), we limit the scope to 5 random users of that group. These accounts are indicated with `'(random)'` after their UPN
- if the CA policy is scoped on `'All guets'`, we limit the scope to 2 random guests. These accounts are indicated with `'(random)'` after their UPN
- if the CA policy is scoped on `'All resources'` cloud apps, we limit the scope to `Office 365 Exchange Online`, `Office 365 SharePoint Online` and `Office 365 Portal`
- if the CA policy is scoped on `Office365` cloud apps, we limit the scope to `Office 365 Exchange Online`, `Office 365 SharePoint Online` and `Office 365 Portal`
- if the CA policy is scoped on more than 3 cloud apps, we limit the scope to the first 3 applications
- if the CA policy is scope on a Named Location, we add tests for each IP range of the Named Location
- if the CA policy is scope on a Named Location, the country of the test will always be `'FR'` (France)

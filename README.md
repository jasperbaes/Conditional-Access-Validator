The Conditional Access Persona Report is part of tool #3 in the <a href="https://www.jbaes.be/CAB">Conditional Access Blueprint</a>, a CA framework.

# üöÄ About

The Conditional Access Persona Report is a PowerShell script that generates a HTML report of all included and excluded Personas of your Conditional Access Policies. This follows the persona-approach of the <a href="https://www.jbaes.be/CAB">Conditional Access Blueprint</a> where the goal is to use a static set Conditional Access policies and only add/remove personas (=Entra groups) as needed.

- 'Add' and 'Remove' buttons that can link to a MSSP support page so customers can request changes
- Automatic generated Maester tests

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

TODO: installation video

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/jasperbaes/Conditional-Access-Persona-Report
cd Conditional-Access-Persona-Report
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication
```

Authenticating can be done with the `Connect-MgGraph` command or with an App Registration. To use an App Registration, set the credentials in the `settings.json` file:

```json
{
    "tenantID": "",
    "clientID": "",
    "clientSecret": "",
    "organizationName": "My Organization",
    "removePersonaURL": "",
    "addPersonaURL": ""
}
```

| JSON key           |               Description |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------: |
| tenantID | Required field when authenticating with App Registration.|
| clientID | Required field when authenticating with App Registration.|
| clientSecret | Required field when authenticating with App Registration.|
| organizationName | Required field.|
| removePersonaURL | Optional field. If you provide this HTML report to customers as part of you MSSP service, `removePersonaURL` can be the link to your Jira, ServiceNow, Microsoft Forms, ... for customers to request a change. Or, you can fill in `mailto:jasper.baes@company.org` to redirect to an email. When `removePersonaURL` is empty, it automatically redirects to the Entra Portal. |
| addPersonaURL | Optional field. If you provide this HTML report to customers as part of you MSSP service, `addPersonaURL` can link to your Jira, ServiceNow, Microsoft Forms, ... for customers to request a change. Or, you can fill in `mailto:jasper.baes@company.org` to redirect to an email. When `addPersonaURL` is empty, it automatically redirects to the Entra Portal.|
